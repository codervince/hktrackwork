Before being allowed to race again, NONE OTHER will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.\nWhen questioned regarding his riding of NONE OTHER, Apprentice K C Ng stated that he had been asked to ride NONE OTHER in a forward position and lead if possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount vigorously out of the barriers in an endeavour to be as forward as possible.  He said RACING HERO, which was drawn inside NONE OTHER, showed more early speed than his mount and he attempted to ride NONE OTHER to obtain a position outside that horse.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion FLYING UNICORN, which was racing to the inside of NONE OTHER, was vigorously ridden to improve its position and therefore passing the 1400 Metres NONE OTHER was left racing in a position three wide and without cover.  He said he felt the tempo of the race in the early stages was good.  He added after allowing NONE OTHER to be balanced rounding the turn near the 1100 Metres, he had a look to his inside to ascertain whether it would be possible to shift NONE OTHER in behind FLYING UNICORN to obtain cover behind that horse. \u00a0He said however that SMILING WATCH was positioned directly behind FLYING UNICORN and for this reason he was not able to obtain cover behind FLYING UNICORN.  He said rather than remain racing three wide and without cover, he therefore elected to ride his mount forward to see whether he would be able to cross FLYING UNICORN.  He said however that FLYING UNICORN maintained its position between RACING HERO and NONE OTHER and as such he was not able to cross that horse.  He added whilst he was aware that the tempo of the race was quick at that time, he felt that that was a better option rather than remaining in a three wide position without cover.  He said in hindsight he considered that it would have been better had he remained racing outside FLYING UNICORN rather than continuing on in an endeavour to clear that runner.  Mr A S Cruz, the trainer of NONE OTHER and allocated trainer of Apprentice Ng, confirmed that he had asked Apprentice Ng to ride the horse positively in tonight\u2019s race.  Apprentice Ng was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he had erred in attempting to press forward on NONE OTHER after the 1100 Metres given the tempo of the race.  Apprentice Ng was reprimanded and advised that whilst he is still an apprentice jockey, he is a senior apprentice and as such he would be expected to ride his mounts with sufficient judgement so as to give them every opportunity to finish off their races.\nZ Purton (RACING HERO) pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct under Rule 155(5) in that in the vicinity of the Weighing Room following the race, he directed an inappropriate comment to Stipendiary Steward E C Kwok.  Having regard to Jockey Purton\u2019s prior record of charges under this Rule, the Stewards were of the opinion that, given the circumstances, the appropriate penalty was for him to be fined the sum of $25,000.\nA veterinary inspection of RACING HERO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of RACING HERO, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, RACING HERO will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.\nA veterinary inspection of FLYING UNICORN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.\nFLYING UNICORN, GOLDLAND DANCER and SMILING WATCH were sent for sampling.", "DeclarHorseWt": 1170, "Sec4DBL": 0.75}

Before being allowed to race again, NONE OTHER will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.\nWhen questioned regarding his riding of NONE OTHER, Apprentice K C Ng stated that he had been asked to ride NONE OTHER in a forward position and lead if possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount vigorously out of the barriers in an endeavour to be as forward as possible.  He said RACING HERO, which was drawn inside NONE OTHER, showed more early speed than his mount and he attempted to ride NONE OTHER to obtain a position outside that horse.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion FLYING UNICORN, which was racing to the inside of NONE OTHER, was vigorously ridden to improve its position and therefore passing the 1400 Metres NONE OTHER was left racing in a position three wide and without cover.  He said he felt the tempo of the race in the early stages was good.  He added after allowing NONE OTHER to be balanced rounding the turn near the 1100 Metres, he had a look to his inside to ascertain whether it would be possible to shift NONE OTHER in behind FLYING UNICORN to obtain cover behind that horse. \u00a0He said however that SMILING WATCH was positioned directly behind FLYING UNICORN and for this reason he was not able to obtain cover behind FLYING UNICORN.  He said rather than remain racing three wide and without cover, he therefore elected to ride his mount forward to see whether he would be able to cross FLYING UNICORN.  He said however that FLYING UNICORN maintained its position between RACING HERO and NONE OTHER and as such he was not able to cross that horse.  He added whilst he was aware that the tempo of the race was quick at that time, he felt that that was a better option rather than remaining in a three wide position without cover.  He said in hindsight he considered that it would have been better had he remained racing outside FLYING UNICORN rather than continuing on in an endeavour to clear that runner.  Mr A S Cruz, the trainer of NONE OTHER and allocated trainer of Apprentice Ng, confirmed that he had asked Apprentice Ng to ride the horse positively in tonight\u2019s race.  Apprentice Ng was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he had erred in attempting to press forward on NONE OTHER after the 1100 Metres given the tempo of the race.  Apprentice Ng was reprimanded and advised that whilst he is still an apprentice jockey, he is a senior apprentice and as such he would be expected to ride his mounts with sufficient judgement so as to give them every opportunity to finish off their races.\nZ Purton (RACING HERO) pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct under Rule 155(5) in that in the vicinity of the Weighing Room following the race, he directed an inappropriate comment to Stipendiary Steward E C Kwok.  Having regard to Jockey Purton\u2019s prior record of charges under this Rule, the Stewards were of the opinion that, given the circumstances, the appropriate penalty was for him to be fined the sum of $25,000.\nA veterinary inspection of RACING HERO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
