He said he was instructed that in the event HAPPY GOAL was not able to cross SIR JOHN and obtain the rail, then he should sit outside that horse.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he rode HAPPY GOAL vigorously in the early stages after being crowded for room on jumping.  He said despite being aggressively ridden, HAPPY GOAL did not show the early speed that he expected, however, he continued to ride the horse along in order to comply with his instructions.  He said although it soon became apparent to him that he would not be able to clear SIR JOHN which began very well, he continued to ride HAPPY GOAL aggressively for the first 200 Metres in order to prevent ENJOY THE FUN from being able to cross HAPPY GOAL.  He said at all stages racing along the Back Straight, ENJOY THE FUN held a margin over HAPPY GOAL and bearing in mind that he had ridden the horse along for such a sustained period in the early stages, he felt it was in the best interests of HAPPY GOAL not to continue riding it along as ENJOY THE FUN was always racing in advance of HAPPY GOAL and he felt that he would have had to make unnecessary use of HAPPY GOAL to prevent ENJOY THE FUN from crossing and consequently HAPPY GOAL would not be able to finish off its race.  He added after being crossed by ENJOY THE FUN near the 800 Metres, HAPPY GOAL then commenced to prove very difficult to settle and had to be continually checked away from the heels of that horse until after the 600 Metres.  He said in this time HAPPY GOAL became unbalanced on a number of occasions after getting its head up when racing close to the heels of ENJOY THE FUN.  Mr L Ho, the trainer of HAPPY GOAL, confirmed Jockey Leung\u2019s advice on how he had asked for HAPPY GOAL to be ridden.  He said whilst he had concerns that HAPPY GOAL may not have been able to cross SIR JOHN, he felt that the horse had sufficient speed to be able to obtain a position outside that horse, however, it was apparent to him that despite Jockey Leung making a more than reasonable effort to comply with his instructions, HAPPY GOAL did not display the early speed today that it had shown in its recent races.  He added HAPPY GOAL had trained on very well since its last start success and the only reason he could put forward for the horse\u2019s failure to show more pace in the early stages was that HAPPY GOAL had climbed steadily in weights which may have impacted upon the horse\u2019s early speed today.  After considering the evidence and viewing the videos, the Stewards advised K C Leung that they accepted his evidence and were satisfied that he had given HAPPY GOAL full opportunity to take up a leading position if it was so able.

He said on jumping WILD BOY and EXCITABLE BOY bumped and then after travelling a short distance WILD BOY was steadied away from the heels of EXCITABLE BOY which shifted out.  He said at this time he received a call from his outside and as he felt that he may have caused interference to his outside as a result of the shift from EXCITABLE BOY, he steadied his mount to allow that horse to continue forward.  He said after the 900 Metres he commenced to ride his mount along to see if it could improve its position and at this time he slapped the horse down the shoulder with the whip.  He said despite this, WILD BOY did not show the speed in the early stages that he expected.  He said near the 800 Metres DIAMOND MASTER was being vigorously ridden to his inside, was racing greenly and was shifting out towards the line of WILD BOY.  He added that he had considered riding WILD BOY along more vigorously at this time to hold his position, however, he felt that the manner in which DIAMOND MASTER was racing may have resulted in interference being suffered by WILD BOY and therefore he elected to allow DIAMOND MASTER to improve forward of WILD BOY.  He said whilst this resulted in WILD BOY racing further back in the field than had been anticipated, he did not believe that WILD BOY was showing sufficient early speed to consolidate its position outside DIAMOND MASTER at this time.  He said as soon as he allowed DIAMOND MASTER to improve forward of WILD BOY approaching the 500 Metres, he immediately commenced to ride his mount along to improve its position.  He said whilst WILD BOY initially took some time to gather momentum, the horse then closed off the race well over the latter stages.  M L Yeung was advised that the Stewards had concerns regarding his riding of WILD BOY in the early stages.  He was told that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he should have made a far greater endeavour to obtain a forward position than he did on this occasion.  He was also told to ensure that he rides his mounts in order to comply with his instructions wherever possible and to leave no room for query as to his intentions to fulfil those instructions.
