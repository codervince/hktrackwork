It was ascertained that KIROV was inadvertently treated with phenylbutazone when SMART BALL (P277) was intended to be treated with this substance.  Acting on a confirmed phone call from Mr D J Hall, the trainer of KIROV, on Saturday, 22 November 2014, KIROV was withdrawn from the entries prior to declarations for this race.  Evidence was tonight taken from Mr Hall, Mr S T Lee, assistant trainer, Mr K H Chow, head lad, Mr K H Wong, work rider, Dr J May, Houseman, Department of Veterinary Clinical Services, and Dr C M Riggs, Head of Veterinary Clinical Services.  Mr Hall pleaded guilty to a breach of Rule 50(2) for having failed in his responsibility for all matters pertaining to the running of his stable.  Mr Hall was fined the sum of $15,000.  In assessing the appropriate penalty, the Stewards took into consideration KIROV was withdrawn prior to declarations.  Mr Lee was advised that no further action would be taken against him whilst Mr Chow and Mr Wong were both advised that a transcript of tonight\u2019s hearing, together with a report, would be forwarded to Stables Management for their consideration.  Dr May was advised that a report on the circumstances of this matter would also be forwarded to Dr Riggs for his consideration.\nCIRCUIT STAR proved difficult to load.

He said approaching the 500 Metres he rode his mount along to take advantage of comfortable running which was available inside WHISTLE BLOWER when that horse hung out.

He added he rode his mount along to have it concentrate and to maintain its position inside WHISTLE BLOWER, however, rounding the Home Turn WINNER ST PAUL\u2019S brushed the running rail and again became badly unbalanced which resulted in the horse blundering shortly after entering the Straight.  He said after this he pushed WINNER ST PAUL\u2019S along in the early part of the Straight, however, as the horse was not responding to his riding and was giving ground and as he had concern over the horse\u2019s action given what had occurred rounding the Home Turn, he eased it down over the final 200 Metres.  A veterinary inspection of WINNER ST PAUL\u2019S immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of WINNER ST PAUL\u2019S, a favourite for tonight\u2019s race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, WINNER ST PAUL\u2019S will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial around a bend and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.\nA veterinary inspection of POWER COOL immediately following the race revealed that the horse was displaying an irregular heart rhythm and an endoscopic examination also showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.
