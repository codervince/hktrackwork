Acting on the Veterinary Officer’s advice that the horse was not suitable to race\, WINNING NINE was withdrawn by order of the Stewards.  Before being allowed to race again\, WINNING NINE will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.  As this was the second occasion that WINNING NINE had had to be withdrawn from its intended race start due to behaviour issues\, Mr T P Yung\, the trainer of WINNING NINE\, undertook to discuss the horse’s immediate racing future with the owners.  Mr Yung was advised that the Stewards would set the matter aside until after that discussion occurred.  In the meantime\, WINNING NINE is not permitted to be entered to race.\nWINNING APEX and GO-GETTER bumped at the start.

He said after the 900 Metres he was able to shift in to assume the lead on the rail and VICTORY GENERAL then commenced to travel satisfactorily.  He said after the 800 Metres TOMODACHI was allowed to improve its position outside VICTORY GENERAL and rather than becoming engaged in a speed battle with that horse\, he elected to allow his mount to settle and shift out to a position one horse off the rail.  He added VICTORY GENERAL came under pressure rounding the Home Turn and immediately came off the bridle.  He said when giving ground in the Straight VICTORY GENERAL got its head up due to its unusual galloping action and then weakened badly in the latter part of the race.  A veterinary inspection of VICTORY GENERAL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.\nWhen questioned regarding the disappointing performance of TOMODACHI\, Apprentice C Y Lui stated that the horse did not show the same early speed that it had shown when he had previously ridden it.  He said because of this he had to make some use of TOMODACHI in the early stages to take up a forward position as instructed.  He said TOMODACHI travelled only fairly in the early and middle stages and for this reason he allowed his mount to improve after the 800 Metres to see whether it would travel more kindly after being able to lead on the rail.  He added at the entrance to the Straight TOMODACHI gave him a limited response when placed under pressure\, however\, weakened out of the race over the final 200 Metres and was disappointing.  A veterinary inspection of TOMODACHI immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.\nA veterinary inspection of WHO CARES immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said it was explained to him that BERLINSKI has a relatively short sprint and it was felt that holding up BERLINSKI for a final run would give the horse the best opportunity to win the race.  He said after racing inside LUGER after the 600 Metres\, he allowed his mount to improve its position in the early part of the Straight as LUGER was clearly not travelling well enough to take him into the race.  He said therefore he improved his position to be racing behind SECRET SHAM\, a horse he considered would finish off strongly.  He added although a run to the outside of SECRET SHAM and inside BULLISH BOY\, which was giving ground\, became available approaching the 300 Metres\, he directed BERLINSKI back in behind SECRET SHAM as his instructions were to wait until about the 250 Metres.  He said when he reached the 250 Metres\, he immediately shifted BERLINSKI to the outside of SECRET SHAM and rode the horse vigorously to the end of the race.  He said when ridden in this manner\, BERLINSKI finished off the race strongly.  Trainer D J Hall advised the Stewards that he had made specific mention of the fact that BERLINSKI has a relatively limited sprint and he asked Jockey Rispoli to follow LUGER for as long as possible in the race as he considered it to be the best horse to follow.

FIVE UP HIGH and ALL WIN BOY were then crowded for room inside ALL THE BEST\, resulting in CLEVER BEAVER being taken in across the heels of SUPREME FALCON and being hampered.\nFrom the outside barriers\, STEP FASTER and POPPING CANDY were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.\nMaking the first turn near the 1000 Metres\, ORIENTAL PROSPER got its head up and raced keenly when being steadied to allow GORGEOUS DEBUT to cross.\nMaking the first turn after the 1000 Metres\, GENTILIS proved difficult to settle and got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of FIVE UP HIGH.\nAfter the 1000 Metres\, GOLDEN DEER was steadied away from the heels of SILLY BUDDIES (K Teetan) which shifted in when not quite clear.  K Teetan was reprimanded and advised to ensure that he is sufficiently clear when shifting ground in future.\nFor some distance approaching and passing the 800 Metres\, POPPING CANDY and ALL THE BEST both proved difficult to settle when awkwardly placed close to the heels of GENTILIS and GOLDEN DEER respectively.\nAt the 600 Metres\, SILLY BUDDIES was taken wider by FIVE UP HIGH which shifted out away from the heels of SUPREME FALCON after being awkwardly placed behind that horse.\nFor some distance approaching the 500 Metres\, STEP FASTER got its head up when being checked away from the heels of ALL WIN BOY and near the 450 Metres shifted out\, resulting in POPPING CANDY becoming unbalanced when crowded for room inside GOLDEN DEER.\nAfter the 150 Metres\, ALL THE BEST shifted in under pressure and raced tight outside GOLDEN DEER.  ALL THE BEST and GOLDEN DEER then continued to race tight until near the 50 Metres due to ALL THE BEST hanging in.\nPassing the 100 Metres\, ORIENTAL PROSPER and GORGEOUS DEBUT made contact due to both horses shifting ground.  GORGEOUS DEBUT (M Guyon) then shifted out further after becoming unbalanced when bumped on the hindquarters by ORIENTAL PROSPER.  M Guyon was advised that whilst there was contribution to this incident by ORIENTAL PROSPER\, nonetheless he was reprimanded and advised to ensure that he makes every endeavour to keep his mounts on a straight course.\nOver the concluding stages\, CLEVER BEAVER\, GORGEOUS DEBUT and SUPREME FALCON raced tight.\nClose to the finishing line\, GENTILIS was awkwardly placed close to the heels of ALL WIN BOY.\nThroughout the race\, SILLY BUDDIES travelled wide and without cover.\nWhen questioned\, J Moreira stated that it has been intended for GENTILIS to be ridden in a forward position.  He said he was asked to lead on GENTILIS however\, if the pace of the race was strong in the early stages\, he should attempt to obtain cover behind the leaders if possible.  He said after being loaded\, GENTILIS initially stood well in the barriers\, however\, just prior to the start being effected\, GENTILIS became fractious and as the gates opened was sitting back in its stall which resulted in it lifting its front feet off the ground and being slow to begin.  He said when this happened he believed that to ride GENTILIS forward at that time was not in the horse’s best interests given that it was anticipated that there was going to be good speed in the race from runners drawn more favourably and that had he have pursued a forward position on GENTILIS\, he would likely have been left racing wide and without cover.  He said he therefore elected to shift GENTILIS across behind runners and obtain cover with a view to being able to finish off the race.  He added making the first turn near the 1000 Metres GENTILIS commenced to prove difficult to settle and was awkwardly placed close to the heels of FIVE UP HIGH.  He said after this GENTILIS was able to travel more comfortably and making the Home Turn was able to improve its position to be racing behind the eventual winner SUPREME FALCON.  He said however that after being placed under pressure in the Straight\, GENTILIS did not finish off its race.  Mr C H Yip\, the trainer of GENTILIS\, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Moreira to obtain a forward position if possible. \nA veterinary inspection of GENTILIS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.\nCLEVER BEAVER\, SUPREME FALCON and GORGEOUS DEBUT were sent for sampling.,1,2,3,1,41,80-60,1060000,TURF,Wednesday,NONE,3,NONE

It was subsequently established that the relevant sample was taken from SOUTHERN SPRINGS\, a declared runner in this race.  After informing Mr C S Shum\, the trainer of SOUTHERN SPRINGS\, of the analyst’s findings\, the Stewards acceded to a request from him to withdraw SOUTHERN SPRINGS from this race.  Accordingly\, SOUTHERN SPRINGS was withdrawn by order of the Stewards.  Further\, urine and blood samples were subsequently taken from SOUTHERN SPRINGS under post-race conditions.  The matter was now adjourned until a date to be fixed.\nAs the start was effected\, MANIPULATION\, which was fractious in the stalls\, lifted its front feet off the ground and made heavy contact with the outside of its stall\, resulting in the horse losing a considerable amount of ground.  Before being allowed to race again\, MANIPULATION will be required to perform satisfactorily in an official barrier trial.\nPassing the winning post on the first occasion\, TOM’S CHARM was steadied away from the heels of SAFARI MAGIC.\nRounding the Home Turn\, CHINA DELIGHT was awkwardly placed close to the heels of GENUINE CHAMPION.\nAfter the 300 Metres\, TOM’S CHARM was shifted in away from the heels of MANIPULATION to obtain clear running.  Then approaching the 200 Metres\, TOM’S CHARM became unbalanced when bumped heavily by MANIPULATION which\, when commencing to give ground\, got its head on the side and shifted in away from ENDORSING (N Rawiller) before being taken in marginally by that horse.  CHINA DELIGHT\, which was racing to the inside of TOM’S CHARM\, blundered when being checked in consequence.  N Rawiller was advised that whilst the racing manners of MANIPULATION had initiated the incident by wanting to lay in away from ENDORSING\, nonetheless he had permitted his mount to shift in which had also contributed to the incident.  N Rawiller was reprimanded and advised to ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground in similar circumstances.\nNear the 100 Metres\, ENDORSING momentarily raced in restricted room between STAR MAJESTIC and SAFARI MAGIC which shifted out under pressure.\nFor the majority of the race\, WINNING APEX travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.\nWhen questioned\, H W Lai stated that he had been asked to ride AMBITIOUS GLORY in about a midfield position as the horse was attempting the 1650 Metres for the first time in its career.  He said he was asked to ride the horse more patiently than had been the case over shorter distances to ensure that AMBITIOUS GLORY would be able to see out the distance of the race.\nA veterinary inspection of UNBEATABLE GUTS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.\nSTAR MAJESTIC and SAFARI MAGIC were sent for sampling.,1,7,5,1,42,60-40,760000,TURF,Wednesday,NONE,4,NONE

ROMAN LEGEND and LUCKY CELEBRITY were hampered and taken wider in consequence.\nANDNOWURMINE got its head up and made the turn after the 600 Metres awkwardly.  SPITFIRE\, which was following ANDNOWURMINE\, shifted out away from the heels of that horse and ran wide.\nApproaching the 500 Metres\, ST YAZIN\, which was racing keenly\, was awkwardly placed close to the heels of ANDNOWURMINE.\nAfter the 500 Metres\, EXCEL ONESELF raced tight inside FANTASTICO.\nPassing the 250 Metres\, ST YAZIN was shifted in away from the heels of TOUCH GO.\nApproaching the 200 Metres\, EXCEL ONESELF was shifted to the outside of FANTASTICO after being disappointed for running between that horse and TRIUMPHANT JEWEL.\nN Callan (FUN ‘N’ GAMES) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that for some distance approaching the 200 Metres he failed to make sufficient endeavours to prevent his mount from shifting in\, resulting in  WINFULL PATROL initially being crowded for room and then after the 200 Metres losing the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  N Callan was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday\, 5 February 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday\, 25 January 2015.\nApproaching the 100 Metres\, TOUCH GO was bumped by ST YAZIN which got its head on the side and shifted out away from WINFULL PATROL.\nAt the 100 Metres\, SPITFIRE was struck over the nose by the whip of B Prebble (LUCKY CELEBRITY).\nWhilst the Stewards were satisfied that the riding of D Whyte (WINFULL PATROL)\, 6th placegetter\, over the concluding stages did not affect the horse’s finishing position\, he was nonetheless reminded of his obligation to ride his mounts out at least hands and heels to the end of the race where circumstances permit.\nWhen questioned\, G Mosse stated that over the concluding stages ST YAZIN was awkwardly placed inside the heels of FANTASTICO after laying out away from WINFULL PATROL.  He said because of the positioning of ST YAZIN at this time\, he was not able to ride the horse out all the way to the end of the race.\nA veterinary inspection of LUCKY CELEBRITY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.\nTRIUMPHANT JEWEL and EXCEL ONESELF were sent for sampling.,1,2,1,1,43,80-60,1060000,TURF,Wednesday,NONE,3,NONE

He said when that horse made a forward move after the 800 Metres\, he attempted to improve with that horse\, however\, ONE OF A KIND was not travelling well at that time and he was not able to immediately improve his position behind LOVING STAR.  He said he felt that at this time he would have had to ride ONE OF A KIND along in order to follow LOVING STAR and he did not believe this was in the horse’s best interests at this stage of the race.  He said therefore he allowed NAVEL ORANGE to shift out behind LOVING STAR and he elected to continue to follow that horse forward as he believed NAVEL ORANGE would be a good chance in the race.  He added however that ONE OF A KIND came under heavy pressure after the 600 Metres and the horse then took some time to commence to travel better.\nWhen questioned regarding the disappointing performance of JOLLY GOOD STAR\, J Moreira stated that he was not able to offer any excuse for the horse’s performance.  He said he was able to travel outside the leader in what was a slowly run race.  He said however JOLLY GOOD STAR came under pressure after the 600 Metres to hold its position and then was disappointing in its failure to finish off the race in the Straight.  A veterinary inspection of JOLLY GOOD STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.\nA veterinary inspection of DUAL HAPPY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.\nJOLLY GOOD STAR\, DRAGON PINS and NAVEL ORANGE were sent for sampling.,1,3,4,1,44,60-40,760000,TURF,Wednesday,NONE,5,NONE

He said JET SET DRAGON\, which was drawn inside HIT THE BID\, showed more early speed than his mount and for this reason making the first turn he elected to see if he was able to obtain a position behind that horse as he believed that he would have had to make too much use of HIT THE BID to clear JET SET DRAGON.  He said in the early part of the Back Straight he was not able to shift in behind JET SET DRAGON and was therefore left racing in a three wide position without cover.  He said although the tempo of the race slowed at the 800 Metres\, he believed that he would have had to make too much use of HIT THE BID to go forward having in mind that he had ridden the horse along in the early part of the race and HIT THE BID was carrying top weight of 133 lbs.\nA veterinary inspection of MY LEGEND and DIAMOND FRIENDS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.\nHIT THE BID\, SEA WARRIOR and HAPPY HOMING were sent for sampling.,1,3,3,1,46,60-40,760000,TURF,Wednesday,NONE,3,NONE
